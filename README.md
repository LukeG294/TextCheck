# TextCheck

**Description:** TextCheck is a Chrome extension that can display pasted text in it's plain form to identify special characters.
Please keep in mind that this extension is still in very early devlopment, and it's likely that features will change significantly over time. They are very minimal for now.

**Contributing:** I really appreciate all contributions. This repository is labeled "hacktoberfest", so pull requests accepted or merged here will count towards the challenge. Please make an issue/feature request before starting a PR. The main code that should be improved is hello.html, as that is what shows up when you open the extension, but if you'd like to edit the manifest feel free to do that too. I will try to update the extension within 24 hours of a PR being made.

**Downloading:** If you are looking to download TextCheck, go ahead and visit https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/textcheck/lakkaggkknfcppjimmjacjconjfnadif?hl=en&authuser=1 Thanks for downloading!

**Contact:** Press "Contact the Devloper" on the Chrome Web Store page (linked above).

**Current version:** 1.0 

**Updates:** 1.1 has just been accepted. It features a nicer background and font. Images of the new extension are still being updated to the store. If you have any feature requests, or other directions this project should travel in, please email me from the Chrome Webstore (see contact section of this README), or just create a feature request under issues.
